# Simple Animations using Allegro
> Recursive Tree Animation and Rain Simulation

This project contains two Allegro animations.  The tree animation simulates the
growth of a pseudo-random tree using a recursive method to draw branches on each
line when it reaches 1/3 its maximum length.  The rain animation simulates rain
with simple drawing of allegro primitives starting from a random initial
configuration

## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up &
running. Install Allegro from https://liballeg.org/.  For MSYS2 users with
`pacman`, you can download the package you need with:

```sh
pacman -S allegro-5 pkg-config
```

Once you have the dependencies installed, run `make`.

```sh
cd src/
make
```

<!-- ### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed. -->

<!-- ### Deploying / Publishing

In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy awesome-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does. -->

## Features

What's all the bells and whistles this project can perform?
* What's the main functionality
* You can also do another thing
* If you get really randy, you can even do this -->

<!-- ## Configuration

Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when
using the project.

#### Argument 1
Type: `String`  
Default: `'default value'`

State what an argument does and how you can use it. If needed, you can provide
an example below.

Example:
```bash
awesome-project "Some other value"  # Prints "You're nailing this readme!"
```

#### Argument 2
Type: `Number|Boolean`  
Default: 100

Copy-paste as many of these as you need.

## Contributing

branch. Pull requests are welcome. -->

## Links

Even though this information can be found inside the project on machine-readable
format like in a .json file, it's good to include a summary of most useful
links to humans using your project. You can include links like:

- Allegro: https://liballeg.org/
- Allegro Wiki: https://wiki.allegro.cc/
